## What's The Move?

What's The Move is an app that helps the user plan a night out. It uses an API from Ticketmaster to display events in a specific area. The user may search for events by State, City, and postal code. The user may also filter events by specific type, such as music or sports, if they want. 

Once a user has submittied the search, a table displays listing 5 events within the users parammeters. From this table, the user may click on the link "Website" and it will then open up a new tab in which the user may purchase tickets for the event. 

Additionally, if the user clicks on the name of the event, a second table displays 5 different breweries in the same area that the user may go and pre-game at before the event. The user may also click on the url and go to the brewery's website to gather more information if so desired.
