 Group Do: Designing your MVP

## Instructions
* With your group, answer each of the following questions:

  1. Who is your target audience?
  target audience is 21+ adults that want to 'pre-game' before an event

  2. What is the problem that the product will address?
    Helping the user plan a night out.

  3. What is the primary goal of the product?
  Helping the user find events in the city and then find a brewery to grab beers at beforehand.

  4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
    As a user, I want to be able to find a list of events in a specific city.
    As a user, I want to be able to find a list of breweries in the city of the event.
    As a user, I want to be able to filter that search by what is the closest to the event.
    

* Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.

* As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:

  1. As a user, I want to post pictures so that I can share my life.
  2. As a user, I want to be able to search for other users so that I can find their list of images.
  3. As a user, I want to be able to view other people's images so that I can keep up with what's happening in their lives. 

* Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren't essential. They should **not** be part of the MVP.
